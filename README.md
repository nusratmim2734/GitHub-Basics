## Introduction

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code, as well as collaborate with others on projects. This guide will walk you through the process of using GitHub, from setting up your account to advanced features and best practices.

## Setting Up GitHub

### Creating an Account
1. Visit https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up" and follow the prompts to create your account
3. Choose a username, enter your email, and create a strong password
4. Verify your email address

### Installing Git
1. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Install Git, following the installation wizard
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run `git --version` to verify the installation

### Configuring Git
Set up your Git identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

## Git Basics

### Key Concepts
- **Repository (Repo)**: A project's folder containing all files and version history
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to the repository
- **Branch**: An independent line of development
- **Remote**: A version of the repository hosted on a server (like GitHub)

### Essential Git Commands
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository
- `git clone`: Copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine
- `git add`: Stage changes for commit
- `git commit`: Create a new commit with staged changes
- `git push`: Upload local commits to a remote repository
- `git pull`: Download and integrate changes from a remote repository
- `git status`: Show the current state of your working directory
- `git log`: View commit history

## Creating and Managing Repositories

### Creating a New Repository on GitHub
1. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of GitHub
2. Select "New repository"
3. Choose a name, description, and visibility (public or private)
4. Initialize with a README if desired
5. Click "Create repository"

### Cloning a Repository
To work on a repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### Making Changes and Committing
1. Make changes to files in your local repository
2. Stage changes: `git add <filename>` or `git add .` for all changes
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"`
4. Push changes to GitHub: `git push origin main`

## Branching and Merging

### Creating a New Branch
```bash
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
# or, in one command:
git checkout -b new-feature
```

### Switching Between Branches
```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

### Merging Branches
```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts
1. Open conflicted files and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. Manually resolve conflicts by editing the file
3. Stage the resolved files: `git add <filename>`
4. Complete the merge by committing: `git commit`

## Collaborating with Others

### Forking a Repository
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select where to fork the repository (your personal account or an organization)

### Keeping Your Fork Updated
1. Add the original repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
   ```
2. Fetch changes from the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```
3. Merge changes into your local main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

## Pull Requests

### Creating a Pull Request
1. Push your changes to your forked repository
2. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub
3. Click "Pull requests" and then "New pull request"
4. Select the branch containing your changes
5. Review the changes and click "Create pull request"
6. Add a title and description for your pull request
7. Click "Create pull request" to submit

### Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests
1. Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab in the repository
2. Click on a pull request to review
3. Review the changes, leave comments, and request changes if necessary
4. When satisfied, click "Merge pull request" (if you have the necessary permissions)

## Issues and Project Management

### Creating an Issue
1. Navigate to the "Issues" tab in the repository
2. Click "New issue"
3. Provide a title and description
4. Assign labels, milestones, and assignees if applicable
5. Click "Submit new issue"

### Using Project Boards
1. Go to the "Projects" tab in the repository
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Choose a template or start from scratch
4. Add columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
5. Create cards for tasks or link existing issues and pull requests

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allow you to automate workflows directly in your repository.

### Creating a Workflow
1. In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory
2. Create a YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`) in this directory
3. Define your workflow using YAML syntax:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        npm install
        npm test
```

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to host websites directly from your GitHub repositories.

### Setting Up GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Choose the source branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)
4. Select a theme (optional)
5. Your site will be published at `https://username.github.io/repository`

## Advanced GitHub Features

### GitHub CLI
GitHub CLI allows you to interact with GitHub from your terminal:
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh  # macOS
# Log in
gh auth login
# Create a pull request
gh pr create
```

### GitHub API
GitHub provides a RESTful API for programmatic access to GitHub data and functionality. You can use it to create integrations, automate workflows, or build GitHub apps.

### GitHub Packages
GitHub Packages is a package hosting service that allows you to host your packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects.

## Best Practices

1. Write clear, concise commit messages
2. Use branches for new features and bug fixes
3. Keep your fork updated with the upstream repository
4. Use meaningful names for branches and pull requests
5. Review your own code before submitting a pull request
6. Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and feature requests
7. Utilize GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
8. Keep sensitive information out of your repositories (use environment variables or GitHub Secrets)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account
- Use a personal access token for HTTPS authentication

### Merge Conflicts
- Pull the latest changes from the main branch before creating a pull request
- Resolve conflicts locally, then push the resolved changes

### Large File Issues
- Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) for large files
- Avoid committing large binary files directly to the repository

### Permission Denied Errors
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions on the repository
- Check that you're using the correct remote URL

Remember, mastering GitHub takes practice. Don't be afraid to experiment with different features and workflows to find what works best for you and your team. Happy coding!
